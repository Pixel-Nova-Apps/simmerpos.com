# Setting up Simmer

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Simmer. If you have any questions, please contact <a href="mailto:help@simmerpos.com">help@simmerpos.com</a>

### 1. Create the required Simmer collections

Start by creating the product grid and modifier collections in your Shopify admin. You will be prompted to create these collections when you first load Simmer within your Shopify admin:

### 2. Add products to the Simmer tile

First create your products within the Shopify Admin then add products to the Simmer product grid collection. These should be products on your food and drinks menu that you want to show in the Simmer POS tile:

From the collection page, click **Browse**:

Then select all of your modifier products and click **Add**:

### 3. Add modifiers (optional)

Modifiers are options that can be added to products such as flavourings and toppings. To add modifiers, create a new product within Shopify and set the collection to 'Simmer: Modifiers'.

You'll now be able to assign the modifier to a product from the Shopify Admin by editing the product and selecting the modifier from within the Modifier Block. Modifiers will be sorted based on the order you add them:

<div class="note-box">
<strong>Note:</strong>  If you can't see the Modifier App Block at the bottom of the product page, you will need to enable it within the App Block section at the bottom of the product page. You will then need to click the pin icon to make the block available for other products.

### 4. Configure POS

Add the Simmer tile to your Shopify POS home screen.

First select the **Add tile** tile from the POS smart grid:
