## Set up Simmer

### 1. Create collections

Start by creating product grid and modifier collections in your Shopify admin. You can do this from the Simmer dashboard.

### 2. Add products

Add products to the product grid collection you've created. These should be products on your menu. Any other merchandise should be added to the cart at the end of the sale using the built in POS features.

### 3. Add modifiers (optional)

Modifiers are options that can be added to products such as flavourings and toppings. To add modifiers, create a new product within Shopify and set the collection to 'Simmer: Modifiers'. You'll now be able to assign the modifier to a product from the Shopify Admin by editing the product and selecting the modifier from within the Modifier Block. Modifiers will be sorted based on the order you add them.

### 4. Configure POS

Add the Simmer tile to your Shopify POS home screen.

## How to use Simmer

### 1. Open the Simmer POS tile

Tap the Simmer tile on your POS to start. You should see a grid of products.

### 2. Create a ticket

Tap **Tickets** in the top right then **Create ticket**. This will take you back to the product grid with your new ticket set as the current ticket.

### 3. Add products to the ticket

Select a product from the grid. This will take you to the product page where you'll be able to select variants and modifiers. When you're happy, click **Add** in the top right and the product will be added to your ticket.

### 4. Next steps

You can either continue adding products to the ticket or click **Add to cart** from either the ticket screen or the product grid. This will copy all items from the ticket to the POS cart, ready for checkout.

If you prefer to complete the sale after your customer has been served, you can continue to another ticket and come back to this ticket later by clicking **Tickets** in the top right then clicking on the ticket number.

### 5. Payment and split bills

After tapping **Add to cart**, you can process payment through your POS just as you would with any other sale. If you have split billing enabled, you can also split the bill between multiple customers.

### 6. Creating a kitchen display (KDS)

Kitchen displays can be any device with a web browser such as iPads, Chromebooks, Smart TVs and laptops. You can also create a Tile within POS linking to the kitchen display URL.

You can create kitchen displays from the Simmer app within Shopify Admin. From the Simmer dashboard scroll down to Kitchen displays and click **Add display**.

You'll then be able to label the display (whatever you like) and select the location of the display. This only applies if you have multiple locations (e.g a New York and San Francisco location).

Once you've created the display, you'll be able to see the URL of the display in the Simmer dashboard. You can either share this URL with the kitchen or add the tile to your POS home screen.

To login to the kitchen display you will need to copy the one time PIN code from the Simmer dashboard by clicking the Eye icon next to your kitchen display. You'll then need to enter this PIN on the kitchen display. Note that this PIN can only be used once, you will have to generate a new PIN if you need to login on another device. Your browser will remember that you are logged in so you won't need to enter the PIN every time.

### 7. Using the kitchen display

Once the kitchen display has been added to your device of choice, you will see a list of tickets that are in the **Sent** status. This means that the server has changed the status from **Open** to **Sent**.

On the kitchen display you can use the **Ready** button to change the status of the ticket to **Ready**. This will remove the ticket from the display and will show as **Ready** on the tickets screen of the Simmer POS extension.
