## Set up Simmer

### 1. Create collections

Start by creating product grid and modifier collections in your Shopify admin. You can do this from the Simmer dashboard.

### 2. Add products

Add products to the product grid collection you've created. These should be products on your menu. Any other merchandise should be added to the cart at the end of the sale using the built in POS features.

### 3. Add modifiers (optional)

Modifiers are options that can be added to products such as flavourings and toppings. To add modifiers, create a new product within Shopify and set the collection to 'Simmer: Modifiers'. You'll now be able to assign the modifier to a product from the Shopify Admin by editing the product and selecting the modifier from within the Modifier Block. Modifiers will be sorted based on the order you add them.

### 4. Configure POS

Add the Simmer tile to your Shopify POS home screen.

## How to use Simmer

### 1. Open the Simmer POS tile

Tap the Simmer tile on your POS to start. You should see a grid of products.

### 2. Create a ticket

Tap 'Tickets' in the top right then 'Create ticket'. This will take you back to the product grid with your new ticket set as the current ticket.

### 3. Add products to the ticket

Select a product from the grid. This will take you to the product page where you'll be able to select variants and modifiers. When you're happy, click 'Add' in the top right and the product will be added to your ticket.

### 4. Next steps

You can either continue adding products to the ticket or click 'Add to cart' from either the ticket screen or the product grid. This will copy all items from the ticket to the POS cart, ready for checkout.

If you prefer to complete the sale after your customer has been served, you can continue to another ticket and come back to this ticket later by clicking 'Tickets' in the top right then clicking on the ticket number.

### 5. Payment and split bills

After tapping 'Add to cart', you can process payment through your POS just as you would with any other sale. If you have split billing enabled, you can also split the bill between multiple customers.
