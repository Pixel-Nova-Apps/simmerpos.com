# Setting up a customer display

## Create a customer display

Customer displays can be any device with a web browser such as iPads, Chromebooks, Smart TVs and laptops. You can also create a Tile within POS linking to the customer display URL.

You can create customer displays from the Simmer app within Shopify Admin. From the Simmer dashboard go to **Displays and printers** and click **Add display** within the Customer display section.
