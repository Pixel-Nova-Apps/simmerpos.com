# Table management

Table management is a flexible feature that can be used for buzzers, flags and more.

There are two concepts:

### Service points

Used to define the name of the table. E.g. “Table 1” or “Flag 1”.

### Service point groups

Used to group service points. E.g. “Indoor tables”, “Flags” or “Buzzers”.

## How to setup table management

First step is to create service points groups:
